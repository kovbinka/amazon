# Constraints

Some boundaries around my project.

## External

- Time constraint: 1 weeks to complete.
- Mobile responsiveness (adaptive design for different devices).
- Restrictions on using specific technologies (only HTML & CSS).
- No full access to Amazonâ€™s frontend systems (e.g. assets and fonts).

## Internal

- Experience with responsive design.
- Resources: only free tools (e.g. Excalidraw).
- Personal circumstances - back problems affecting long hours at the computer.
