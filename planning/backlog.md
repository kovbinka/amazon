### Must-Haves

> these are necessary for basic usability

- As a user, I need a `nav-bar` overview so I can navigate and see the cart and
  login section.
- As a user, I need a `trend-section` so I will better understand what is
  trending now.
- As a user, I need useful `product` so I can see what products are sold on the
  site.
- As a user, I need useful `footer` so I can learn more about the site, about
  delivery, about types of payments etc.

### Should-Haves

> these will complete the user experience, but are not necessary

- As a user I want to see some `reviewed-earlier` so I can see products that
  have been reviewed before.

### Could-Haves

> would be really cool ... if there's time

- As a user I want to see some `change-language` so I can change the language on
  the site
